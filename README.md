# Meteorology 224 - Air Pollution Meteorology
#### This repository contains programs I coded for my activities in my graduate class in Air Pollution Meteorology.

Each folder corresponds to one activity, and contains different set of files:

### 1. DataSets
Some of the data were given to us by our professor, while some are obtained online. The websites where I obtained the data are indicated in the written lab report.

### 2. Lab Report
The Lab Reports are .pdf files containing all the final output plots and diagrams of each activity. 
They also contain some introduction, specifications of the methodology, and results & discussion.

### 3. Python script
Each activity folder contains one or more Python script containing the codes (in Python) I used for the activity.
